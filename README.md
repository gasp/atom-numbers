This package will add interesting features related to numbers like :
 * increment/decrement numbers (even with unit or currency like $, px, inch)
 * semver operations (increment major, minor or patch)
 * insert special numbers (Pi)
 * evaluate and replace mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, division, substraction, and more)

## Key binding
* ctrl-alt-i: Increment selected numbers by 1
* ctrl-alt-j: Decrement selected numbers by 1
* ctrl-alt-v M: (SemVer) Increment major version by 1
* ctrl-alt-v m: (SemVer) Increment minor version by 1
* ctrl-alt-v p: (SemVer) Increment patch version by 1
* ctrl-alt-shift-c: Calculate selected operation. Ex. `1+1` will be replaced by `2`, `1200/2` by `600` and so on...

## Coming soon features
* find numbers
* bulk operations
* convert to text
